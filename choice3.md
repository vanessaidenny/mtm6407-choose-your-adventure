## Walk around the mansion
<br/>

> You open the gate, turn right, and walk into a track through which you will arrive in the backyard, noticed by a wooden sign next to the entrance.
><br/>
> You pass the vine arches and enter the track flooded with exotic scents. You can only see grass and vine barely in the dark, so you decide to go
> deeper to find the origin.
><br/>
> You are spellbound by the mysterious scents. There is a shadow following you, but you do not notice.
