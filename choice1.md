## Open the mansion door
<br/>

> In the heart of the abandoned mansion, every step echoed with secrets.  The air, thick with the scent of decay, carried faint, ghostlyã€€whispers.  
> A sense of unseen eyes watching your every move made the atmosphere even more unnerving.
> Amidst the shadowed corridors, you discovered an ancient library.  Its shelves held a peculiar book, glowing faintly and resonating with the same
> eerie energy as the artifact in Eldridge.  Opening it, a gust of wind extinguished the candles, and the whispers intensified.  The book, filled 
> with cryptic writings, was the key to unraveling the mansion's mysteries and the artifact's influence.  But as you read, shadows began to stir 
> aware of your discovery.  
> An unexplainable chill ran down your spine, as if the very soul of the mansion was awakening.
